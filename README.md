Read the complete file to understand the repos past, present & future.

# Past of the repository
The Batch 18-22 folder originally was a drive link created by Sandesh Hegde (batch 22) and whoever helped him. 
This was earlier known as "The Drive Notes", but due to some reason the notes disappeared in the year 2023.
This folder is the offline backup saved by me.

# Present of the repository
I recreated the drive link but it takes 2+ GB space and managing, uploading new material etc. falls solely on me.
So I switched to github rather than a drive-link to basically turn it into a open source.
This legacy of notes can only be continued if everyone works and contributes to it.

# Future of the repository
I wont be deleting this repo until and unless problem arises, and also if I delete it there will be multiple people who can fork this repo thereby being more reliable.

This repository is still under works and we require your help to continiously improve it. Since the syllabus keeps on changing it gets harder to keep it upto date.
